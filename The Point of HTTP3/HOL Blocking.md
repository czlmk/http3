1. **TCP Head-of-Line Blocking**: Even though HTTP/2 introduced multiplexing (multiple requests and responses over a single connection), it was still susceptible to head-of-line blocking at the TCP level as it considers every request (including multiplexed ones) as a single byte stream. 
	
	If a single packet was lost, it would block all streams, even if the packet was only relevant to one of them.

2. In HTTP/3, the issue is addressed via implementation of UDPâ€™s out-of-order delivery, allowing data packets to be processed as they arrive, regardless of their original send order.
